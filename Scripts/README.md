<h1>Scripts</h1>

This folder contains all of the GDScript files used in the game. The primary script is `main.gdscript`, which holds most of the core game logic and functionality. It acts as the central hub for gameplay systems and orchestrates the behavior of various components. All scripts are written in [GDScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/index.html).
