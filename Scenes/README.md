<h1>Scenes</h1>

This folder contains all of the game's scenes used throughout development. The majority of the game's structure, logic, and content is centralized in the `core_scene.tscn` file, which serves as the main scene in the project. These scenes are created and managed using the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).
